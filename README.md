# Bike Sales Excel Dashboard Analysis Project
## About
The goal of this project was to explore bike sales data for more insightful information and create visuals for easy understanding. An interactive dashboard was created in Excel with various slicers connecting all four charts made from pivot tables.

## Data set

## Data Cleanup Process

- Renamed values for easier understanding (Marital status; replaced 'M' with 'Married' an 'S' with 'Single')
- Created a new column to categorize customers' age groups with IF statements
